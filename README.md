# 🐰 Cloud-Bunny

Meh : Cloud-Bunny is an automated pod anomaly detector that gives solutions using LLM technology (currently supporting GPT-3). The concept is to have a first-responder-like tool that can be used by DevOps and infrastructure team. I made it public because I guess someone could use it or use as inspiration altough it's just a practice tool... 

I'll be working on it as part of a hobby I guess :')
